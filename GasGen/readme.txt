This repo have six files:
  * d3js-converter.py (This script is responsible of the generation of the json file from the datasheet).

  Web files (Attention):
    * celegans-hierarchy.html (the rendering of the DataViz)
    * style.css (Style of celegans-hierarchy.html)
    * d3.js (Module of D3JS - www.d3js.org)
    * d3_002.js (Module of D3JS - www.d3js.org)
    * celegans.json (json file is used for celegans-hierarchy.html to generate the DataViz, thanks to D3JS).
    
    * Because of browser restrictions on loading JSON locally (see here: https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally), 
the DataViz only works if is executed from a web server or for tests in the localhost. (With XAMPP, LAMPP...others)
    * python -m SimpleHTTPServer run from within the directory is a good way to run this 
    * Then you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the content
