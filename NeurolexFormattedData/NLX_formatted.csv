- They contribute to a residual chemotactic response to cAMP, biotin, Cl-, and Na+ after ASE is killed (Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991). C. elegans shows chemoattraction to low NaCl. This is mediated by four pairs (ADF, ASE, ASG and ASI) of amphid sensory neurons, of which the ASE cells are most important. It also shows avoidance of NaCl concentrations above 200 mM which is thought to be due to a general avoidance of high osmotic strength (mainly mediated by the ASH sensory neurons). However, this response to salt is plastic, involving a balance between attraction and avoidance, i.e., balances between ASE, ASI, ASH, ADF and perhaps ADL neuron (Hukema et al, 2006).
 - Control entry into dauer stage; ADF, ASI and ASG inhibit entry into dauer stage while ASJ and ASK promote dauer entry (Kim et al., 2009; Ouellett et al., 2008; Schackwitz et al., 1996; Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991).
 - Function as part of the oxygen-sensing network (which also includes URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, ALN, PLN, ADL, and ASH) by promoting hyperoxia avoidance. ADF pair stimulates aerotaxis in the absence of food by producing serotonin (Chang et al., 2006).
 - Modulate NMJ neurotransmission; serotonin functions as a neuromodulator by inhibiting and enhancing synaptic transmission of other neurotransmitters; e. g. studies have revealed both stimulatory and inhibitory serotonin inputs to the NMJs. Aldicarb, an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, causes paralysis in C. elegans due to accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) at the locomotory NMJs, but exogenous serotonin inhibits paralysis induced by aldicarb. By contrast, exogenous serotonin does not reduce the paralysis induced by levamisole, a specific agonist of the nicotinic ACh receptor UNC-29 in the bodywall muscles. This suggests that serotonin signaling inhibits ACh release by the motor neurons. Studies showed that the inhibitory and stimulatory serotonin signals to NMJ neurotransmission arise from distinct serotonergic neurons; endogenous serotonin released from the ADF neurons stimulates ACh synaptic transmission at the NMJs, whereas serotonin from the NSM/RIH/AIM neurons inhibits the stimulatory serotonin inputs (Govorunova et al., 2010).","","","","","","Sensory neuron","OpenWorm 2013 Parcel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Lateral ganglia in head","","","","","","","","","","","","- Serotonin

After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory), AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008). This memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation at a different temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). The AFD, AWC and ASI neurons may to act in concert to increase turning rate when animals encounter higher temperatures than Tc on a gradient to move down the gradient toward colder temperatures near Tc (negative thermotaxis) (Biron et al., 2008). To track isotherms, animals do not actively pursue isothermal alignment, but once serendipitously aligned along an isotherm (at T=Tc), they track by suppressing turns (Luo et al., 2006).This may be achieved by the animal increasing its reversal frequency when it detects a rise in temperature, which activates Ca++ influx in AFD via cGMP-dependent TAX-2/TAX-4 cation channel (cGMP production in AFD is redundantly carried out by GCY-8, GCY-18 and GCY-23 and gcy-23, gcy-8, and gcy-18 triple mutants show a cryophilic or athermotactic phenotype) (Inada et al., 2006). AFD neurons respond to thermal stimuli above Tc with continuous, graded calcium signals in a deterministic and highly reproducible way. The thermal information is transmitted by AFD and AWC to AIY interneurons for information processing, and AIY neurons, in turn, transmit it to AIZ and RIA interneurons for further processing. It is suggested that activation of AFD neurons by warming above Tc induces the animal to reverse by inhibiting AIY since loss of AFD (by ablation) suppresses spontaneous reversals in an AIY-dependent manner, while loss of AIY (by ablation) increases spontaneous reversals (de Bono and Maricq 2005; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).
 - Functions in locomotion: Laser ablations of AFD cause hyporeversal phenotype (Tsalik and Hobert, 2003).
 - AFD, BAG and ASE are primary CO2 sensors: AFD and BAG neurons together stimulate turning when CO2 rises and inhibit turning when CO2 falls (Bretscher et al., 2011).

AIA pair is suggested to sum inputs from various chemosensory neurons before passing the information on to AIB pair, which synapses onto motor neurons (AIA-AIB connections are likely to be inhibitory) (Wakayabashi et al., 2004).

"AIYL","","","","","","Amphid interneuron","","","","","AIY neurons are postsynaptic to several olfactory and gustatory sensory neurons, such as ASE, ASI, AWA, AWC and AFD, and are presumed to play an integrative role, processing multiple streams of sensory information. They have a key role in behavioral plasticity in paradigms in which starvation is paired with a thermal or chemical cue (de Bono and Maricq, 2005; Ishihara et al., 2002).
 - Functions in thermotaxis; laser ablation of the AIY pair makes the animals cryophilic and impaired in isothermal tracking (Mori and Ohshima, 1995). The thermal information sensed by AFD, AWC and ASI is processed in downstream interneurons AIY, AIZ, RIA, and also likely in AIA and AIB (the first three are considered as thermotaxis core interneurons) (Ma and Shen, 2012; Sasakura and Mori, 2012; Ardiel and Rankin, 2011; Beverly et al, 2011). The activation of AIY neuron-signaling drive warm-seeking (thermophilic) movement, the activation of AIZ neuron-signaling drive cold-seeking (cryophilic) movement, while the counterbalancing between the AIY and AIZ signals through the RIA interneuron leads to execution of motor output in response to thermal signals (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008). AIY is the major postsynaptic partner of AWC and AFD. AWC-derived glutamatergic signals stimulate AIY and induce migration to warmer temperature (Ohnishi et al, 2011). AFD transmits both inhibitory and stimulatory signals to AIY such that calcium concentration threshold in AFD acts as a switch for opposing neural signals to AIY that direct opposite (warm- or cold-seeking) behaviors (Kuhara et al., 2011). AFD-derived glutamatergic signals inhibit AIY through activation of GLC-3 glutamate-gated chloride channel and drive migration towards colder temperature. Recent studies suggest this AFD / AIY synapse may have evolved for reliable transmission of a scaled-down temperature signal from AFD, enabling AIY to monitor and integrate temperature with other sensory inputs (Narayan et al, 2011). The molecular mechanism of the stimulatory signaling between AFD and AIY is currently unknown.
 - Functions in locomotion: Suppresses turns and reversals enhancing smooth forward movements and dispersal, since laser ablation of AIY increases reversals and turns, disrupts dispersal behavior and shortens forward movements (Gray et al., 2005; Wakayabashi et al., 2004 ; Tsalik and Hobert, 2003). Similar to AIY, laser ablations of ASE or AIA increases the frequency of reversals while ablations of AWC, AIB or AIZ decreases the frequency of reversals (ablations of RIA does not affect turning rates). Since ablations of AIY and AIZ (the major postsynaptic partner of AIY) cause opposite behavioral phenotpes, the synapses made by AIY onto AIZ may be inhibitory. Alternatively, signals fom AIY to AIZ are processed in a downstream neuron such as RIA (de Bono and Maricq 2005).

"AIZL","","","","","","Ring Interneurons","","","","","Integration of information from amphid sensory neurons; AIZL/R is one of the four first layer amphid interneuron pairs (AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ) that receive and process synaptic output from the amphid sensory neurons towards a behavioral response. Along with the second layer RIA and RIB interneurons, AIZ also receives heavy input from the first layer AIA, AIB, AIY interneurons and itself sends inputs to RIA and RIB. Additionally, it synapses directly onto SMB head motor neurons .
 - Functions in thermotaxis; laser ablation of the AIZ pair makes the animals thermophilic (Mori and Ohshima, 1995). The thermal information sensed by AFD, AWC and ASI is processed in downstream interneurons AIY, AIZ, RIA, and also likely in AIA and AIB (the first three are considered as thermotaxis core interneurons) (Ma and Shen, 2012; Sasakura and Mori, 2012; Ardiel and Rankin, 2011; Beverly et al, 2011). In the original two-drive model of thermotaxis, activation of AIY neuron-signaling drive warm-seeking (thermophilic) movement, activation of AIZ neuron-signaling drive cold-seeking (cryophilic) movement, while the counterbalancing between the AIY and AIZ signals possibly through the RIA interneuron leads to execution of motor output in response to thermal signals (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008). However, there is evidence that a thermophilic drive at temperatures below cultivation temperature (Tc) does not exist and regulation of thermotaxis involves a more complex circuit (Ma and Shen, 2012; Ryu and Samuel, 2002). Around Tc animals track isothermally on a gradient and above Tc they display negative thermotaxis by regulating their turning frequency and run duration. It has been suggested that thermosensory signals from AFD, AWC and ASI converge on the AIB interneuron in negative thermotaxis, whereas the AIY/AIZ/RIA network may function mainly in isothermal tracking (Ma and Shen, 2012).
 During associative learning between temperature and feeding state, starvation, a conditioning factor, downregulates AIZ activity through calcineurin/TAX-6, a calcium-activated phosphatase, leading to avoidance from Tc (Kuhara and Mori, 2006).
- Functions in locomotion: Laser ablations of AIZ, like AIB and AWC, cause decrease in reversals and lead to large increases in the duration of forward movement (Tsalik and Hobert, 2003; Iino and Yoshida, 2009). Since ablations of AIY and AIZ cause opposite behavioral phenotpes, the synapses made by AIY onto AIZ may be inhibitory. Alternatively, signals fom AIY to AIZ could be processed in a downstream neuron such as RIA (de Bono and Maricq 2005).
- Functions in chemotaxis: Laser ablations of AIZ cause defects in the weathervane (slow turning of the animal by biased head swing) and pirouette (bout of sharp turns generated by frequent reversals followed by omega turns) responses (see Nervous System-General Description) leading to impaired chemotaxis (Iino and Yoshida, 2009).","","","","","","Interneuron","OpenWorm 2013 Parcel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ventral ganglion in head","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innexin Expression:    Receptor Expression: - SER-2; tyramine receptor (expresses two separate splice variants)

"AIZR","","","","","","Ring Interneurons","","","","","Integration of information from amphid sensory neurons; AIZL/R is one of the four first layer amphid interneuron pairs (AIA, AIB, AIY, and AIZ) that receive and process synaptic output from the amphid sensory neurons towards a behavioral response. Along with the second layer RIA and RIB interneurons, AIZ also receives heavy input from the first layer AIA, AIB, AIY interneurons and itself sends inputs to RIA and RIB. Additionally, it synapses directly onto SMB head motor neurons .
 - Functions in thermotaxis; laser ablation of the AIZ pair makes the animals thermophilic (Mori and Ohshima, 1995). The thermal information sensed by AFD, AWC and ASI is processed in downstream interneurons AIY, AIZ, RIA, and also likely in AIA and AIB (the first three are considered as thermotaxis core interneurons) (Ma and Shen, 2012; Sasakura and Mori, 2012; Ardiel and Rankin, 2011; Beverly et al, 2011). In the original two-drive model of thermotaxis, activation of AIY neuron-signaling drive warm-seeking (thermophilic) movement, activation of AIZ neuron-signaling drive cold-seeking (cryophilic) movement, while the counterbalancing between the AIY and AIZ signals possibly through the RIA interneuron leads to execution of motor output in response to thermal signals (Ohnishi et al, 2011; Kuhara et al, 2008). However, there is evidence that a thermophilic drive at temperatures below cultivation temperature (Tc) does not exist and regulation of thermotaxis involves a more complex circuit (Ma and Shen, 2012; Ryu and Samuel, 2002). Around Tc animals track isothermally on a gradient and above Tc they display negative thermotaxis by regulating their turning frequency and run duration. It has been suggested that thermosensory signals from AFD, AWC and ASI converge on the AIB interneuron in negative thermotaxis, whereas the AIY/AIZ/RIA network may function mainly in isothermal tracking (Ma and Shen, 2012).
 During associative learning between temperature and feeding state, starvation, a conditioning factor, downregulates AIZ activity through calcineurin/TAX-6, a calcium-activated phosphatase, leading to avoidance from Tc (Kuhara and Mori, 2006).

Opposite intacellular Ca++ transients are suggested to be generated in ASEL and ASER in response to changes in NaCl concentrations (Suzuki et al., 2004). 
- ASH, ADL, ASK and ASE sensory neurons are responsible for the detection of certain chemical repellents. ASH plays a major role in this avoidance, whereas ADL, ASK and ASE play minor roles that are only evident when ASH is missing (Hiliard et al., 2002; Sambongi et al., 1999; Bargmann et al, 1990.) Mediate avoidance behavior from Cd2+ and Cu2+ (Sambongi et al., 1999)

- Controls entry into dauer stage (Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991).
 - Functions in locomotion: Suppresses omega turns and reversals enhancing dispersal (Gray et al., 2005). After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns. This is followed by dispersal ~30 min later as reversal and turns are suppressed. Local search behavior is triggered by AWC olfactory neurons, ASK gustatory neurons, and AIB interneurons while dispersal is promoted by ASI gustatory neurons and AIY interneurons (Gray et al., 2005).
 - Thermosensor: After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory), AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008).

UNC-6 also promotes bundling of axons within the cord itself. If the parent of AVG is ablated in wild-type embryos, interneurons and ventral cord motor neurons form several small fascicles rather than one tight bundle of right side tract and occasionally the right side axons shift to the left side (Wadsworth et al., 1996; Wadsworth and Hedgecock, 1986; Durbin 1987; Antebi et al., 1997).","","","","","","Interneuron","OpenWorm 2013 Parcel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Retrovesicular ganglion of head","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Innexin Expression:    Receptor Expression: Express glutamate receptor subunits, GLR-1, GLR-2, NMR-1 and NMR-2 (Maricq et al., 1995; Brockie et al., 2001).

- They function in induction of local search behavior and promoting turns. After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns. This is followed by dispersal ~30 min later as reversal and turns are suppressed. Local search behavior is triggered by AWC olfactory neurons, ASK gustatory neurons, and AIB interneurons while dispersal is promoted by ASI gustatory neurons and AIY interneurons (Gray et al., 2005).The AWC neurons synapse onto several interneurons including AIB and AIY, which enhance and suppress turning, respectively. The AWC neurons activate the AIB interneurons through AMPA-type glutamate receptors and inhibit AIY interneurons through glutamate-gated chloride channels. AWC are odor-OFF neurons that are activated by odor removal and inhibited in the continued presence of odors. On prolonged exposure to odorant (over 30 min), adaptation to AWC-sensed odors occurs, abrogating the chemotactic response. NLP-1 is required for these AWC-dependent food-evoked behaviors and odor adaptation (Chalasani et al., 2010; Chalasani et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2005; L'Etoile and Bargmann, 2000; Bargmann et al., 1993).
 - Thermosensor: After cultivation at a uniform temperature (Tc) with sufficient food, animals preferentially migrate to their cultivation temperature (Tc) when placed on a thermal gradient, and move isothermally at this temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Animals sense and record their Tc by AFD (major thermosensory) and AWC and ASI neurons (Beverly et al, 2011; Kuhara et al., 2008; Biron et al., 2008). This Tc memory is plastic and can be reset upon cultivation at a different temperature (Hedgecock and Russell 1975). Activity of both the AFD and the AWC neurons is essential for the execution of thermotactic behaviors with high fidelity and precision. Upon sensation of a higher temperature than Tc, Ca++ concetration in AWC increases via production of cGMP by ODR-1 and activation of cGMP-dependent TAX-4 cation channel (Kuhara et al., 2008). Unlike AFD neurons, which respond to thermal stimuli above Tc with continuous, graded calcium signals in a deterministic and highly reproducible way, AWC neurons exhibit stochastic temperature-evoked Ca++ changes that are stimulus-correlated with different temporal kinetics at temperatures above and below Tc (Biron et al., 2008). AWC appears to get more active as temperatures rise or fall  further from Tc. The AFD, AWC and ASI neurons seem to act in concert to increase turning rate when animals encounter higher temperatures than Tc on a gradient to move down the gradient toward colder temperatures near Tc (negative thermotaxis) (Biron et al., 2008). To track isotherms, animals do not actively pursue isothermal alignment, but once serendipitously aligned along an isotherm (at T=Tc), they track by suppressing turns (Luo et al., 2006). AWC neurons are relatively quiet around temperatures close to the Tc.

DVA represents a stretch receptor neuron that regulates sensory-motor integration during C. elegans locomotion. trp-4, a homologue of the mechanosensitive TRPN channel, acts as a stretch-sensitive proprioceptor in DVA.

"I5","","","","","","Pharyngeal interneuron. I5 has a very large cell body which is located on the ventral side of the terminal bulb. Two short branches come out of the cell body and split into anterior and posterior projections. At the level of the terminal bulb commissure, the anterior processes end on the cell bodies of M2 motor neurons and are linked to them by desmosomes. Posteriorly, the processes run between pm6 and pm7 and reach a subdorsal position adjacent to the subdorsal marginal cells. Each branch then travels anteriorly to the terminal bulb commissure where they fuse across the dorsal side. Ventrally, these also become attached to the cell bodies of M2 motor neurons by desmosomes. At the level of the subventral nerve cords each branch turns anteriorly and travels to the nerve ring. They make a single closed loop within the nerve ring. A short anterior projection is also seen in the dorsal side of the nerve cord (Albertson and Thomson, 1976).","","","","","M3 and I5 are suggested to facilitate bacterial trapping by regulating the relative duration of muscle relaxation in different regions of the pharynx (Avery, 1993). Pharyngeal relaxation becomes quicker when I5 is ablated. When both I5 and M3 are ablated there is a delay in relaxation that is indistinguishable from that caused by ablation of M3 alone, suggesting I5 slows down relaxation by inhibiting M3 (Avery and Thomas, 1997)","","","","","","Pharyngeal interneuron","OpenWorm 2013 Parcel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pharynx posterior bulb","","","","","","","","","","","","Serotonin, based on serotonin immunoreactivity (Sawin et al., 2000).

"NSML","","","","","","NSM cell bodies are located in the pharyngeal subventral nerve cords just anterior to the nerve ring. These cells are bipolar with one major process from each cell bifurcating near the cell body to two thick processes. There is also a third, long, thin process that originates from the cell body and possibly functions as proprioceptive (Axang et al., 2008). One of the two main branches crosses to the opposite side, turns dorsally within the nerve ring and continues its trajectory posteriorly within the dorsal nerve cord of the isthmus. The other branch runs posteriorly within the subventral nerve cord of the isthmus. These processes run at the most outside edge of the nerve cords, very close to pseudocoelom, and make synapses to the pharyngeal basement membrane and muscle cells. Both processes terminate before reaching the terminal bulb. Within the isthmus these processes periodically swell to form varicosities filled with large, lightly- and darkly-staining membrane bound vesicles, as well as small clear vesicles. 
Along with these major processes NSM's also have small, synapse-free processes with free endings just under the cuticle of the pharyngeal lumen at the boundary between the corpus and isthmus (where bacteria accumulate). These endings are attached to the adjacent muscle cells by desmosomes and are thought to act as stretch (proprioceptive) receptors. These processes can not be seen at the light microscopic level (therefore not obvious in GFP images below). They have also been omitted from the drawn images below. The NSM's receive extensive synapses from I2 (see connectivity diagram below) (Albertson and Thomson, 1976).

They were postulated to sense bacteria in their lumen by their proprioceptive endings and transmit this to the rest of the body by secretions to the pseudocoelomic fluid. The presence of food leads to increased pharyngeal pumping, decreased locomotion and increased egg-laying behavior. Exogenous application of serotonin also induces these responses supporting the hypothesis NSM's can function neurohumorally by serotonin secretion.

"URXL","","","","","","Nonciliated endings in head, associated with CEPD in embryo. Like AQR and PQR, URX are directly exposed to the pseudocoelomic fluid and are proposed to monitor the contents of this fluid.","","","","","Function in aerotaxis: When placed in an O2 gradient, C. elegans shows a strong behavioral preference for ~5–10% (intermediate) O2 levels and avoids both hypoxia (<7%) and hyperoxia (21%). Animals navigate the O2 gradients by O2-induced changes in locomotion speed, reversal and turning behavior  (Cheung et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2004). This preference for intermediate O2 levels (Gray et al., 2004), may work to allow oxidative metabolism but avoid oxidative stress (Lee and Atkinson, 1977). The intermediate O2 preference also promotes aggregation behavior, possibly since aggregating C. elegans locally deplete O2 to preferred levels (Gray et al., 2004; Rogers et al., 2006). The rise in O2 levels detected by animals leaving a group induces reversal (backing) and turning. Conversely, the fall in O2 encountered when entering a group suppresses reversal, turning, and rapid locomotion, allowing the animal to stay with the group. Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC, e.g. GCY-35 and GCY-36)-expressing oxygen-sensing neurons (URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, BDU, ALN, and PLN) mediate the avoidance of high O2 levels (Zimmer et al, 2009). URX appears to be the most important member of this group, since its activity is uniquely important for aggregation (Coates and de Bono, 2002), while for aerotactic behavior in an O2 gradient, URX is redundant with other sGC-expressing neurons (Chang et al., 2006). The locations of URX in the head and PQR in the tail facilitate high O2 avoidance by the animal accelerating forward without changing direction of movement when its tail/PQR encounters high O2 and by reversal and turning when its head/URX encounters high O2 (Busch et al., 2012). Two post-synaptic targets of URX, AUA and RMG, seem to be involved in this O2-induced behavioral response.
 The strength of the O2 response is regulated by food, genotype, and an animal’s prior O2 exposure. The lab standard wild-type C. elegans strain (N2) with high activity (due to a gain-of-function mutation) of the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 (215V) is indifferent to high O2 when food is present, whereas C. elegans isolates with low activity of NPR-1 (215F) avoid high O2 in the presence of food, and therefore, aggregate (Gray et al., 2004; Cheung et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2006). Since all strains avoid high O2 when food is absent, NPR-1 may be an internal food sensor important for food-related regulation of aggregation (i.e., regulation of social behavior on food) (Chang et al., 2006). Cultivation conditions also regulate O2 preference: animals cultivated in hypoxia migrate to lower O2 levels, and avoid high O2 regardless of food or NPR-1 genotype (Cheung et al., 2005; Chang and Bargmann, 2008). The sensory neurons ASH, ADL, and ADF also promote avoidance of high O2 levels (through function of TRP-related channel subunits OCR-2 and OSM-9 and the transmembrane protein ODR-4 in nociceptive ASH and ADL, and serotonin production by ADF), but these cells are not needed after animals are cultivated in hypoxia (Chang et al., 2006; Chang and Bargmann; 2008; Rogers et al., 2006).","","","","","","Sensory neuron","OpenWorm 2013 Parcel","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Head","","","","","","","","","","","","- FLP-8; FMRFamide-like peptide

"VC1","","","","","","Hermaphrodite specific ventral cord motor neurons. The neurons are born in L1, and begin to send out processes in late L3. These processes branch in the region of the vulva during L4. VC4 and VC5 have short ventral cord processes, but send branched processes dorsally along the vulval hypodermis on each side of the vulval slit. VC1-3 and VC6 send less branched processes to vulval regions but have longer processes in the ventral cord (in R side fascicle). The dorsal branches of VC axons innervate vm2 vulval muscles. These neurons, except VC4 and VC5, also innervate ventral body muscles. 
The generation of VC neurons from the 6 Pn.a neuroblast lineages (P3.a-P8.a) is dependent on a HOM-C gene, lin-39. In the absence of lin-39, these neurons undergo programmed cell death (Ruvkun, 1997). The formation of the complex arborizations made by VC neuron branches at the level of the vulva depend on the presence of the vulval cells and the somatic gonad but not on the interactions of VC's with target muscles or HSN neurons (Li and Chalfie, 1990; Colavita and Tessier-Lavigne, 2003) For a more detailed anatomical description of VC neurons also refer to Reproductive System-Egg-laying apparatus.","","","","","Acetylcholine released from the VC neurons inhibits egg-laying behavior. This may be caused by inhibition of presynaptic neurotransmitter release by HSN neurons following the activation of the G-protein- coupled acetylcholine receptor 2 (GAR-2) signaling (Bany et al., 2003).
