Running the code
----------------
* Because of [browser restrictions on loading JSON locally](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally), the DataViz only works if is executed from a web server or for tests in the localhost. (With XAMPP, LAMPP...others)
* <pre>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</pre> run from within the directory is a good way to run this 
* Then you can navigate to http://localhost:8000 to see the content
